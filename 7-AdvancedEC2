# Advanced EC2

## Bootstrapping EC2 using User Data
Bootstrap in certain config in EC2 instance
Bootstrapping- allow system to self-configure or launch with configs
Bootstrapping allows *EC2 Build Automation*
User Data- Accessed via the meta-data IP
    - http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
    - Anything you pass in is executed by instance OS, just once at launch
EC2 doesn't interpret or validate data, just passes to OS, runs as root user

AMI -> Instance (with EBS volume attached based on AMI mapping) <- User Data from EC2
    - Instance executes User Data -> Running/Ready for Service OR Bad Config (still passes status checks)

User Data is opaque to EC2 - it's just a block of data
It's NOT secure - don't use for passwords or long-term credentials
Limited to 16KB in size
    - larger? use script to download data
Can be modified when instance stopped...
But only executed once at launch

## Boot-Time-To-Service-Time
Includes time to provision + updates/installations
AMI -> Minutes to Instance -> Post Launch Time (minutes to hours)
    - Bootstrapping automates post launch time
AMI Bake (frontload work) -> Ami -> Minutes to Instance
- Maybe AMI bake in installation, Bootstrap config (optimal)
