# EXAM

## General AWS Exam Technique - 3 Phase Approach

25% Easy questions
50% Medium questions
25% Hard questions

Phase 1
- Go through all questions, answer easy
- takes little time, low mistake chance

Phase 2
- remaining questions, mark Hard questions for review
- Power through medium questions
- bulk of exam time, this is what allows you to pass

Phase 3
- "Red" Questions, Hard
- if out of time, guess!
- don't focus on hard questions at beginning of exam

## Tips
- assume you will run out of time
- be efficient, have a process
- 2 minutes to read Q + answers and make a decision
- Don't guess until the end... later questions may remind you of something important from earlier
- Use the "Mark for Review" feature
- Take practice tests
  - tutorialsdojo.com (more difficult)

## General AWS Question Technique

- 1-2 lines of preamble (scenario) - focus on keywords and concepts
- Question itself
- 4-5 answers - multiple choice or multi-select
  - multi-select- told how many answers to pick
- Associate level- generally simple right and wrong
- occasionally "most suitable" from some right answers
- generally 1 or 2 answers which can be excluded... locate those first
- most have overall criteria or restriction
  - cost effective
  - best practice Security (do what AWS wants you to do)
  - highest performance (inverse of cost) 
  - timeframe (e.g. 1 week to deploy, can't use DX)
