# S3

## S3 Security (Resource Policies and ACLs)
S3 is private by default
    - only identity with initial access is account root user, all other permissions explicitly granted
  
S3 Bucket Policy
    - resource policy
      - like identity policy, but attached to bucket
      - can allow access from other accounts
      - allow/deny anonymous principals
 Bucket: secretcatproject
    - attached: Bucket Policy
    `"Principal": "*",`
        - defines who statement applies to, not in identity policy (because it by definition applies to that user)
        - * means policy applies to anyone accessing bucket, can perform defined action
        - can only have one bucket policy, with many statements

Access Control Lists (ACLs)- on objects or buckets
    - Subresource
    - Legacy (use policies instead)
    - Inflexible, simple permissions

Block Public Access
    - Resource Permissions- public could access bucket with no restrictions if turned on
    - AWS added Block public access settings
    - Failsafe

### Which policy?
Identity: controlling diff. resources
Identity: you have a preference for IAM
Identity: same account
Bucket: just controlling S3
Bucket: anonymous or cross-account
ACLs: never- unless you must
